# Open Weather API Service

This project is a service that collects data from the Open Weather API and stores it as JSON.

## Technical Decisions

### Flask[async]
I chose Flask because it is more straightforward and allows for quicker development to complete the test, given that it is not a very robust system. I used async due to the asynchronous requirement.

### requests
Used to make requests to the Open Weather API using Python.

### pytest and pytest-cov
I selected pytest because it is one of the most robust and popular testing libraries in Python and also provides coverage features.

### python-dotenv
I used python-dotenv to load environment variables from a `.env` file into Python, facilitating the management of sensitive configurations like API tokens.
